Hello, I'm Simone Di Leo. 
I have a BSc Degree in **Sofware Enginering**, a MSc in **Management Engineering** and a Phd in **Industrial and Management Engineering**. 
I am currently an  **Assistant Professor (Not Tenure Track) - RTD-A ** at **Sapienza University of Rome** with a focus on the strategic analysis of retail energy markets using non-parametric techniques and machine learning.
My research focuses mainly on data-driven policy analysis and non-parametric frontiers.
I work also in ETL, Quantitative Data Analysis, Text Mining, **Data visualization** and Applied quantitative analysis on regulated industries/markets.

I don't think there's a position for the jobs I've done in the past... let's just say I do a little bit of everything in the data environment.
