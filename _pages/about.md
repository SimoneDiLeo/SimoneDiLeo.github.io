I am currently a  **Resarch Fellow** at **Sapienza University of Rome** with a focus on non parametric frontier analysis.
I have a Phd in Management and Industrial engineering with a strong focus on data driven policy analysis.
I work also in ETL, Data Analysis, Text Mining, Data visualization and infographics, etc...
I don't think there's a position for the jobs I've done in the past...
let's just say I do a little bit of everything in the data environment.
